LUKE'S PSEUDOCODE

(after a game ends)

ask for the user's name
if that name already has a profile
    put new scores on the file
    tell the user that the scores were put in
if else that name doesn't have a profile
    ask the user for their favorite game genre
    create a profile with their information and scores and put it on the file
    tells the user that their profile was made

(Lets the user play the game again if they want to or go to the game menu)
